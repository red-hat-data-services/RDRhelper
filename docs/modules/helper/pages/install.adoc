The Regional DR helper tool (also known as RDRhelper) can be used to simplify the OADP-based Regional DR available to OpenShift clusters with OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) starting with 4.7.

NOTE: Regional DR is not currently a supported feature of ODF and thus there is also no support for the RDRhelper
